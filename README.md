# Face-Detection

There are two projects under this repository ,both of which are face detection.
In the first one,I was able to detect the face given an image of the Nobel Prize Winner Dr.Dennis Mukwege.

In the second project under this ,live face detection is performed and my face was detected input being  WebCamera of my laptop.The image of which is attached in this README.
(As during live face detection,a new dialog box is opened ,the image is not included in the code so I attach it here)
